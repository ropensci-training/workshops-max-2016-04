## taxize - two organizing principles

`taxize` - [https://github.com/ropensci/taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize)

- Data sources
    - Lots of data sources, currently 20
- Verbs (ish)
    - `classification()`
    - `children()`
    - `downstream()`
    - `comm2sci()` / `sci2comm()`
    - `resolve()`
    - `synonyms()`

## Why taxize?

> A single easy to use user interface to many data sources can simplify science, and make it more reproducible

## Why...more

* Many biologists deal with names at some point in their research = taxonomy is fundamental data
* Integrations: After names are cleaned, integrate with other parts of research workflow
  * taxonomy -> biodiversity data
  * taxonomy -> phylogenetics
  * taxonomy -> molecular work

## Other taxonomic tools

* `taxa` - taxonomic classes - in development [https://github.com/ropenscilabs/taxa](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/taxa)
* `binomen` - manipulations on taxonomic classes - [https://github.com/ropenscilabs/binomen](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/binomen)
* `taxizedb` - taxonomic databases - [https://github.com/ropenscilabs/taxizedb](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/taxizedb)

* `Taxonstand` - [https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Taxonstand/](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Taxonstand/)
