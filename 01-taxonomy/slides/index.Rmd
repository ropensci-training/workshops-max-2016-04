## taxonomic names

* Everyone's gotta deal with em = taxonomy is fundamental data
* Integrations: After names are cleaned, integrate with other parts of research workflow
    * taxonomy -> biodiversity data
    * taxonomy -> phylogenetics
    * taxonomy -> molecular work

## taxize - two organizing principles

- Data sources
    - Lots of data sources, currently 20
- Verbs (ish)
    - `classification()`
    - `children()`
    - `downstream()`
    - `upstream()`
    - `comm2sci()` / `sci2comm()`
    - `resolve()`
    - `synonyms()`
    - `lowest_common`

## Why taxize?

> A single easy to use user interface to many data sources can simplify science, and make it more reproducible
