## What common fields exist?

We need some fields to merge on.

Typically, this is species, location, date, etc.

## Do any variables need to be standardized?

* Dates
* Coordinates
* Taxonomic names
* Missing values

## Joining

* the excel join
* In R:
	* `rbind()` / `cbind()` / `merge()`, etc.
	* `dplyr`: `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `semi_join()`, `anti_join()`
